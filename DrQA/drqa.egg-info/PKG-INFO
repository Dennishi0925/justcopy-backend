Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License ("Public
License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You
such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.
  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards
     commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of
     this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for
     other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital
     file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is
     no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the
     exchange.

  j. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  k. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  l. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
               NonCommercial purposes only.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
          the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
          purposes.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
     only;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

Description: # DrQA
        This is a PyTorch implementation of the DrQA system described in the ACL 2017 paper [Reading Wikipedia to Answer Open-Domain Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00051).

        ## Machine Reading at Scale
        
        <p align="center"><img width="70%" src="img/drqa.png" /></p>
        
        DrQA is a system for reading comprehension applied to open-domain question answering. In particular, DrQA is targeted at the task of "machine reading at scale" (MRS). In this setting, we are searching for an answer to a question in a potentially very large corpus of unstructured documents (that may not be redundant). Thus the system has to combine the challenges of document retrieval (finding the relevant documents) with that of machine comprehension of text (identifying the answers from those documents).
        
        Our experiments with DrQA focus on answering factoid questions while using Wikipedia as the unique knowledge source for documents. Wikipedia is a well-suited source of large-scale, rich, detailed information. In order to answer any question, one must first retrieve the few potentially relevant articles among more than 5 million, and then scan them carefully to identify the answer.
        
        Note that DrQA treats Wikipedia as a generic collection of articles and does not rely on its internal graph structure. As a result, **_DrQA can be straightforwardly applied to any collection of documents_**, as described in the retriever [README](scripts/retriever/README.md).
        
        This repository includes code, data, and pre-trained models for processing and querying Wikipedia as described in the paper -- see [Trained Models and Data](#trained-models-and-data). We also list several different datasets for evaluation, see [QA Datasets](#qa-datasets). Note that this work is a refactored and more efficient version of the original code. Reproduction numbers are very similar but not exact.

        Question Answering (QA) is a computer science discipline within the fields of

        humans in a natural language.

        [ Doc = Phrases from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ]
        The number 42 and the phrase, "Life, the universe, and everything" have
        attained cult status on the Internet. "Life, the universe, and everything" is
        a common name for the off-topic section of an Internet forum and the phrase is
        invoked in similar ways to mean "anything at all". Many chatbots, when asked
        about the meaning of life, will answer "42". Several online calculators are
        also programmed with the Question. Google Calculator will give the result to
        "the answer to life the universe and everything" as 42, as will Wolfram's
        Computational Knowledge Engine. Similarly, DuckDuckGo also gives the result of
        "the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything" as
        42. In the online community Second Life, there is a section on a sim called
        43. "42nd Life." It is devoted to this concept in the book series, and several
        attempts at recreating Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, were made.

        In 1954, the Yankees won over 100 games, but the Indians took the pennant with
        an AL record 111 wins; 1954 was famously referred to as "The Year the Yankees
        Lost the Pennant". In , the Dodgers finally beat the Yankees in the World
        Series, after five previous Series losses to them, but the Yankees came back
        strong the next year. On October 8, 1956, in Game Five of the 1956 World
        Series against the Dodgers, pitcher Don Larsen threw the only perfect game in
        World Series history, which remains the only perfect game in postseason play
        and was the only no-hitter of any kind to be pitched in postseason play until
        Roy Halladay pitched a no-hitter on October 6, 2010.

        ## Installing DrQA
        
        _Setting up DrQA is easy!_
        
        DrQA requires Linux/OSX and Python 3.5 or higher. It also requires installing [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/). Its other dependencies are listed in requirements.txt. CUDA is strongly recommended for speed, but not necessary.
        
        Run the following commands to clone the repository and install DrQA:
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/DrQA.git
        cd DrQA; pip install -r requirements.txt; python setup.py develop
        ```
        
        Note: requirements.txt includes a subset of all the possible required packages. Depending on what you want to run, you might need to install an extra package (e.g. spacy).
        
        If you use the CoreNLPTokenizer or SpacyTokenizer you also need to download the Stanford CoreNLP jars and spaCy `en` model, respectively. If you use Stanford CoreNLP, have the jars in your java `CLASSPATH` environment variable, or set the path programmatically with:
        
        ```python
        import drqa.tokenizers
        drqa.tokenizers.set_default('corenlp_classpath', '/your/corenlp/classpath/*')
        ```
        
        **IMPORTANT: The default [tokenizer](#tokenizers) is CoreNLP so you will need that in your `CLASSPATH` to run the README examples.**
        
        Ex: `export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/path/to/corenlp/download/*`.
        
        If you do not already have a CoreNLP [download](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/index.html#download) you can run:
        
        ```bash
        ./install_corenlp.sh
        ```
        
        Verify that it runs:
        ```python
        from drqa.tokenizers import CoreNLPTokenizer
        tok = CoreNLPTokenizer()
        tok.tokenize('hello world').words()  # Should complete immediately
        ```
        
        For convenience, the Document Reader, Retriever, and Pipeline modules will try to load default models if no model argument is given. See below for downloading these models.
        
        ### Trained Models and Data
        
        To download all provided trained models and data for Wikipedia question answering, run:
        
        ```bash
        ./download.sh
        ```
        
        _Warning: this downloads a 7.5GB tarball (25GB untarred) and will take some time._
        
        This stores the data in `data/` at the file paths specified in the various modules' defaults. This top-level directory can be modified by setting a `DRQA_DATA` environment variable to point to somewhere else.
        
        Default directory structure (see [embeddings](scripts/reader/README.md#note-on-word-embeddings) for more info on additional downloads for training):
        ```

        Default model paths for the different modules can also be modified programmatically in the code, e.g.:
        
        ```python
        import drqa.reader
        drqa.reader.set_default('model', '/path/to/model')
        reader = drqa.reader.Predictor()  # Default model loaded for prediction
        ```

        #### Wikipedia
        
        Our full-scale experiments were conducted on the 2016-12-21 dump of English Wikipedia. The dump was processed with the [WikiExtractor](https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor) and filtered for internal disambiguation, list, index, and outline pages (pages that are typically just links). We store the documents in an sqlite database for which `drqa.retriever.DocDB` provides an interface.
        
        | Database | Num. Documents | Size |
        | :------: | :------------: | :-----------------: |
        | [Wikipedia](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fair-data/drqa/docs.db.gz) | 5,075,182 | ~13GB |
        
        #### QA Datasets
        
        The datasets used for DrQA training and evaluation can be found here:
        
        - SQuAD: [train](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/dataset/train-v1.1.json), [dev](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/dataset/dev-v1.1.json)
        - WebQuestions: [train](http://nlp.stanford.edu/static/software/sempre/release-emnlp2013/lib/data/webquestions/dataset_11/webquestions.examples.train.json.bz2), [test](http://nlp.stanford.edu/static/software/sempre/release-emnlp2013/lib/data/webquestions/dataset_11/webquestions.examples.test.json.bz2), [entities](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fair-data/drqa/freebase-entities.txt.gz)
        - WikiMovies: [train/test/entities](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fair-data/drqa/WikiMovies.tar.gz)
        (Rehosted in expected format from https://research.fb.com/downloads/babi/)
        - CuratedTrec: [train/test](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fair-data/drqa/CuratedTrec.tar.gz)
        (Rehosted in expected format from https://github.com/brmson/dataset-factoid-curated)
        
        ##### Format A
        
        The `retriever/eval.py`, `pipeline/eval.py`, and `distant/generate.py` scripts expect the datasets as a `.txt` file where each line is a JSON encoded QA pair, like so:
        
        ```python
        '{"question": "q1", "answer": ["a11", ..., "a1i"]}'
        ...
        '{"question": "qN", "answer": ["aN1", ..., "aNi"]}'
        ```
        
        Scripts to convert SQuAD and WebQuestions to this format are included in `scripts/convert`. This is automatically done in `download.sh`.
        
        ##### Format B
        
        The `reader` directory scripts expect the datasets as a `.json` file where the data is arranged like SQuAD:
        
        ```
        file.json
        ├── "data"
        │   └── [i]
        │       ├── "paragraphs"
        │       │   └── [j]
        │       │       ├── "context": "paragraph text"
        │       │       └── "qas"
        │       │           └── [k]
        │       │               ├── "answers"
        │       │               │   └── [l]
        │       │               │       ├── "answer_start": N
        │       │               │       └── "text": "answer"
        │       │               ├── "id": "<uuid>"
        │       │               └── "question": "paragraph question?"
        │       └── "title": "document id"
        └── "version": 1.1
        ```
        
        ##### Entity lists
        
        Some datasets have (potentially large) candidate lists for selecting answers. For example, WikiMovies' answers are OMDb entries while WebQuestions is based on Freebase. If we have known candidates, we can impose that all predicted answers must be in this list by discarding any higher scoring spans that are not.
        
        ## DrQA Components
        
        ### Document Retriever
        
        DrQA is not tied to any specific type of retrieval system -- as long as it effectively narrows the search space and focuses on relevant documents.
        
        Following classical QA systems, we include an efficient (non-machine learning) document retrieval system based on sparse, TF-IDF weighted bag-of-word vectors. We use bags of hashed n-grams (here, unigrams and bigrams).
        
        To see how to build your own such model on new documents, see the retriever [README](scripts/retriever/README.md).
        
        To interactively query Wikipedia:
        
        ```bash
        python scripts/retriever/interactive.py --model /path/to/model
        ```
        
        If `model` is left out our [default model](#document-retriever-1) will be used (assuming it was [downloaded](#installing-drqa)).
        
        To evaluate the retriever accuracy (% match in top 5) on a dataset:
        
        ```bash
        python scripts/retriever/eval.py /path/to/format/A/dataset.txt --model /path/to/model
        ```
        
        ### Document Reader
        
        DrQA's Document Reader is a multi-layer recurrent neural network machine comprehension model trained to do extractive question answering. That is, the model tries to find the answer to any question as a text span in one of the returned documents.
        
        The Document Reader was inspired by, and primarily trained on, the [SQuAD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05250) dataset. It can also be used standalone on such SQuAD-like tasks where a specific context is supplied with the question, the answer to which is contained in the context.
        
        To see how to train the Document Reader on SQuAD, see the reader [README](scripts/reader/README.md).
        
        To interactively ask questions about text with a trained model:
        
        ```bash
        python scripts/reader/interactive.py --model /path/to/model
        ```
        
        Again, here `model` is optional; a [default model](#document-reader-1) will be used if it is left out.
        
        To run model predictions on a dataset:
        
        ```bash
        python scripts/reader/predict.py /path/to/format/B/dataset.json --model /path/to/model
        ```
        
        ### DrQA Pipeline
        
        The full system is linked together in `drqa.pipeline.DrQA`.
        
        To interactively ask questions using the full DrQA:
        
        ```bash
        python scripts/pipeline/interactive.py
        ```
        
        Optional arguments:
        ```
        --reader-model    Path to trained Document Reader model.
        --retriever-model Path to Document Retriever model (tfidf).
        --doc-db          Path to Document DB.
        --tokenizers      String option specifying tokenizer type to use (e.g. 'corenlp').
        --candidate-file  List of candidates to restrict predictions to, one candidate per line.
        --no-cuda         Use CPU only.
        --gpu             Specify GPU device id to use.
        ```
        
        To run predictions on a dataset:
        
        ```bash
        python scripts/pipeline/predict.py /path/to/format/A/dataset.txt
        ```
        
        Optional arguments:
        ```
        --out-dir             Directory to write prediction file to (<dataset>-<model>-pipeline.preds).
        --reader-model        Path to trained Document Reader model.
        --retriever-model     Path to Document Retriever model (tfidf).
        --doc-db              Path to Document DB.
        --embedding-file      Expand dictionary to use all pretrained embeddings in this file (e.g. all glove vectors to minimize UNKs at test time).
        --candidate-file      List of candidates to restrict predictions to, one candidate per line.
        --n-docs              Number of docs to retrieve per query.
        --top-n               Number of predictions to make per query.
        --tokenizer           String option specifying tokenizer type to use (e.g. 'corenlp').
        --no-cuda             Use CPU only.
        --gpu                 Specify GPU device id to use.
        --parallel            Use data parallel (split across GPU devices).
        --num-workers         Number of CPU processes (for tokenizing, etc).
        --batch-size          Document paragraph batching size (Reduce in case of GPU OOM).
        --predict-batch-size  Question batching size (Reduce in case of CPU OOM).
        ```
        
        ### Distant Supervision (DS)
        
        DrQA's performance improves significantly in the full-setting when provided with distantly supervised data from additional datasets. Given question-answer pairs but no supporting context, we can use string matching heuristics to automatically associate paragraphs to these training examples.
        
        >Question: What U.S. state’s motto is “Live free or Die”?
        >
        >Answer: New Hampshire
        >
        >DS Document: Live Free or Die
         **“Live Free or Die”** is the official **motto** of the **U.S. state** of _**New Hampshire**_, adopted by the **state** in 1945. It is possibly the best-known of all state mottos, partly because it conveys an assertive independence historically found in American political philosophy and partly because of its contrast to the milder sentiments found in other state mottos.
        
        The `scripts/distant` directory contains code to generate and inspect such distantly supervised data.
        
        ### Tokenizers
        
        We provide a number of different tokenizer options for convenience. Each has its own pros/cons based on how many dependencies it requires, overhead for running it, speed, and performance. For our reported experiments we used CoreNLP (but results are all similar).
        
        Available tokenizers:
        - _CoreNLPTokenizer_: Uses [Stanford CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) (option: 'corenlp'). We used v3.7.0. Requires Java 8.
        - _SpacyTokenizer_: Uses [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) (option: 'spacy').
        - _RegexpTokenizer_: Custom regex-based PTB-style tokenizer (option: 'regexp').
        - _SimpleTokenizer_: Basic alpha-numeric/non-whitespace tokenizer (option: 'simple').
        
        See the [list](drqa/tokenizers/__init__.py) of mappings between string option names and tokenizer classes.

        ## Connection with ParlAI
        
        This implementation of the DrQA Document Reader is closely related to the one found in [ParlAI](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI). Here, however, the work is extended to interact with the Document Retriever in the open-domain setting. It is also somewhat more efficient to train and achieves slightly better performance given that the ParlAI API restrictions are lifted (e.g. with respect to preprocessing, answer spans, etc).
        
        We plan to consolidate this model into the ParlAI interface as well, so that the reader can be interchangeably trained here or multitasked on many datasets with ParlAI.
